## Presentation

This starter kit is here to easily start a repository for Wild Code School students.

It's symfony website-skeleton project with some additional library (webpack, fixtures) and tools to validate code standards.

* GrumPHP, as pre-commit hook, will run 2 tools when `git commit` is run :

    * PHP_CodeSniffer to check PSR12
    * PHPStan focuses on finding errors in your code (without actually running it)
    * PHPmd will check if you follow PHP best practices

  If tests fail, the commit is canceled and a warning message is displayed to developper.

* Github Action as Continuous Integration will be run when a branch with active pull request is updated on github. It will run :

    * Tasks to check if vendor, .idea, env.local are not versionned,
    * PHP_CodeSniffer, PHPStan and PHPmd with same configuration as GrumPHP.

## Getting Started for Students

### Prerequisites

1. Check composer is installed
2. Check yarn & node are installed

### Install

1. Clone this project
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `yarn install`
4. Run `yarn encore dev` to build assets

### Working

1. Run `symfony server:start` to launch your local php web server
2. Run `yarn run dev --watch` to launch your local server for assets (or `yarn dev-server` do the same with Hot Module Reload activated)

### Testing

1. Run `php ./vendor/bin/phpcs` to launch PHP code sniffer
2. Run `php ./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src --level max` to launch PHPStan
3. Run `php ./vendor/bin/phpmd src text phpmd.xml` to launch PHP Mess Detector
4. Run `./node_modules/.bin/eslint assets/js` to launch ESLint JS linter

### Windows Users

If you develop on Windows, you should edit you git configuration to change your end of line rules with this command:

`git config --global core.autocrlf true`

The `.editorconfig` file in root directory do this for you. You probably need `EditorConfig` extension if your IDE is VSCode.

### Run locally with Docker

1. Fill DATABASE_URL variable in .env.local file with
`DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@database:3306/<choose_a_db_name>"`
2. Install Docker Desktop an run the command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
3. Wait a moment and visit http://localhost:8000


## Deployment

Some files are used to manage automatic deployments (using tools as Caprover, Docker and Github Action). Please do not modify them.

* [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile) Web app configuration for Docker container
* [docker-entry.sh](/docker-entry.sh) shell instruction to execute when docker image is built
* [nginx.conf](/ginx.conf) Nginx server configuration
* [php.ini](/php.ini) Php configuration


## Built With

* [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony)
* [GrumPHP](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp)
* [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
* [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)
* [PHPMD](http://phpmd.org)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

#  Presentation de la LIGNE BLEUE

The "Ligne Bleue" project by La Banque Postale is an initiative aimed at promoting digital inclusion by helping individuals in digital distress acquire essential digital skills. It is an educational platform that offers tutorials and resources to enable users to develop their knowledge and skills in the digital domain.

The key features of "Ligne Bleue" include:

Tutorials: Users have access to a wide range of tutorials covering various topics related to digital technology, such as internet navigation, social media usage, email management, online security, and more. These tutorials are designed in a pedagogical manner to facilitate user learning.

Quizzes: To assess their level of skills, users can participate in interactive quizzes. These quizzes allow them to test their knowledge and track their progress. Quiz results are recorded and can be viewed on the user's profile.

User Profile: Each user has a personal profile where they can track their progress, view their quiz results, and see the tutorials they have completed. The profile provides an overview of the user's acquired skills and encourages them to continue their learning journey.

Adding Friends: Users have the option to add other application users as friends. Adding friends promotes the social aspect of the platform and encourages users to support each other in their learning journey.

In summary, the "Ligne Bleue" project is an educational platform focused on digital inclusion. It offers tutorials, quizzes, and a user profile to help individuals in digital distress develop their digital skills, assess their level, and track their progress. Additionally, social features such as adding friends foster interaction among users and create a supportive learning community.

## Bundles
For this project we used many bundles : 

* ### KNP Paginator Bundle : 
For the administrable part. This bundle is specifically designed for Symfony and offers pagination functionality, allowing me to manage and display large datasets efficiently.
* ### FOS CKEditor Bundle :
We used for the admin section. It integrates the CKEditor rich text editor into Symfony easily, providing advanced functionality for managing HTML content.
* ### Doctrine Fixture Bundle :
Symfony extension for automated loading of test data into the database.
* ### Exercise HTMLPurifier Bundle :
Symfony bundle for sanitizing and filtering HTML input to prevent XSS attacks and maintain secure content.
* ### Symfony UX / Stimulus :
* #### StimulusBundle:
Symfony bundle that integrates the Stimulus JavaScript framework, providing a lightweight and modular approach to enhance interactivity and behavior in web applications.
* #### TwigComponentBundle:
Symfony bundle that enhances the Twig templating engine by providing a set of reusable and modular components, allowing for more efficient and organized development of user interface elements in web applications.
* #### Live Component : 
For the bookmark component.
* ### Progressbar.js : 
A simple code example of creating a Line shaped progress bar and animating it from 0% to 100%.
